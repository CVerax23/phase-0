# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

This is a critical section and something that should be stressed a bit more as far as the curriculum goes. Meditation and mindfulness techniques are something I've been familiar with for quite awhile now during my own meditation practice outside of DevBootcamp so it was wonderful to see them brought up here.

Time boxing is the most critical of the time management techniques I learned from this material. Knowing when to take break and reflect upon the progress made is crucial to understanding weaknesses in strategy and overall has an extremely positive effect on reaching the goal at hand.

A timebox is a previously agreed period of time during which a person or a team works steadily towards completion of some goal. Rather than allow work to continue until the goal is reached, and evaluating the time taken, the timebox approach consists of stopping work when the time limit is reached and evaluating what was accomplished.

I plan on time-boxing every module's workload at one hour intervals, with a longer break every 3 hours for overall reflection. I feel that as the course load increases, that will be the most time effective ratio work to reflection, and it suits my pace so far.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is an interpreter that provides a traditional user interface for the Unix operating system. Bash (Bourne Again Shell ) is a type of shell distributed with Linux and Macs and providing the interface. The most challenging thing was simple the length of the material, other than that it was pretty standard and I had no problem using all of the commands. I feel like there are no commands intrinsically any greater in importance than other commands, the importance of each being relative to it's need and use, however, clearly the more frequently used commands (pwd, cd ..) could be described in such a manner.

pwd - print working directory, writes the full pathname of the current working directory

ls- command to list files in the current working directory.

mv - command to move working files from one directory to another.

cd - change directory, command to change from one directory to another

../- informs the shell that the absolute path of the file is the current working directory

touch - Unix command-line interface program which is used to update the access date and / or modification date of a file or directory but really is practice is used when creating or opening a file.

mkdir - create a directory

less - used to view the contents of a text file one screen at a time.

rmdir- remove a directory

rm- remove a file

help- display info about bash commands

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

Instructions for creating a repository:

1) Navigate to guthub.com, create a profile and login.

2) In the upper right hand corner of your Github page click the "+" sign, and select new repository (or repo)

3) Name your repository (or project), select Public or Private along with any licenses you may desire and select "Create Repository". DONE

Instructions for cloning a repository:

1) On the page for your repository in the lower left hand corner there is a URL in a box, copy that URL.

2) On your computer, using command line, enter into the folder you want to put your project in, and enter the command "git clone (and paste that URL here)". DONE.

When we clone a repository, we are making a copy on our local machine form which to work on, but let's say we wanted to work on another person's project (or repo), then we would use the fork command. A fork creates a personal copy of someone else's project for us to work with.

Instructions for forking a repository:

1) Go to the Github page of the repository you are wanting to contribute towards.

2) In the upper right hand corner you'll see the work Fork, click on fork and when prompted select your username as the account to fork the repository to, and after a few seconds you will see a copy of that repository with your username in front of it, this copy is your forked copy to work with. DONE.



STRUGGLES:

My only main struggle was the fact that the curriculum doesn't explicitly state or mention creating a folder on your personal machine to clone repo's to. I realize it's an obvious step, but for those of us trying to follow each step religiously, the omission of that basic step seems like a glaring oversight.
