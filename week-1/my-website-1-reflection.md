Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Instructions for creating a repository:

1) Navigate to guthub.com, create a profile and login.

2) In the upper right hand corner of your Github page click the "+" sign, and select new repository (or repo)

3) Name your repository (or project), select Public or Private along with any licenses you may desire and select "Create Repository". DONE

Instructions for cloning a repository:

1) On the page for your repository in the lower left hand corner there is a URL in a box, copy that URL.

2) On your computer, using command line, enter into the folder you want to put your project in, and enter the command "git clone (and paste that URL here)". DONE.

When we clone a repository, we are making a copy on our local machine form which to work on, but let's say we wanted to work on another person's project (or repo), then we would use the fork command. A fork creates a personal copy of someone else's project for us to work with.

Describe what open source means.

Open source is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I love it. It feels like we are all working to better each other creating a synergy of efforts.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

In order to have the legal right to use software to achieve the required needs, the rights and limits in the associated software license take on critical importance.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The concept of creating and working on content in a new branch really clicked for me this time, prior I really didn't understand the process or workflow and was just repeating the commands blindly, no longer is that the case.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
