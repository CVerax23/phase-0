How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Chrome DevTools provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application. Use the DevTools to efficiently track down layout issues, poisition elements and get insights for code optimization.



How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

Using commands requestAnimationFrame, setTimeout or customEvent, as follows:

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Static - This is the default for every single page element. With all elements they all start out as static.

Relative - Limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. Any element that is a child of the relatively positioned element can be absolutely positioned within that block

Absolute - Allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want using the positioning attributes top, left bottom and right to set the location.

Fixed - A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself. The viewport doesn't change when the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Margin - relates to how the outside of your element is effecting how far your element is away from other elements.

Padding - is applied to the inside of your element, which effects how far your element's content is away from the border.

Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.


What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate & why?)

I really loved it, Chrome Devtools are an absolute joy to work with and take all the monotonus parts of positioning and creates a simple and powerful manner of interacting with them to create your site.
