What is an integer? What is a float?

Putting it simply once again, an integer in Ruby is a class that's a number without any decimal points, while a float, or "floating-point" is a class that is usually at least one digit before the decimal point.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

In Ruby the division operator depends on the class of the operands if both operands are integer than integer division (div) is performed with an integer result, if wither operands is a floating point, then floating-point division occurs (fdiv) and the result is expressed as a floating point class value.
