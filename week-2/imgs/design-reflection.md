<h3>What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?</h3>
<p>
      The primary purpose of the site is to be a defacto portfolio of my work as a programmer, along with being a niche blog focusing on my progress learning software development and my key qualities which would be desirable for an employer.
</p>

<h3>What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?</h3>
<p>
    My target audience is potential employers, and the site will address them by offering a sampling of my skills and an exhibition of a portfolio of my projects to see if I'd be a proper fit for the job.
</p>

<h3>What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.</h3>
<p>
    The primary action a user should take when first comming to my sight is to view the main intro video, which will be a specially crafted promo of myself. After that I would like them to browse the site, checking out my blog, going through my archive of completed projects and eventually looking at my resume and contact information if interested.

<h3>What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?</h3>
<p>
    User experience (abbreviated as UX) is how a person feels when interfacing with a system.
    Those who work on UX (called UX designers) study and evaluate how users feel about a system, looking at such things as ease of use, perception of the value of the system, utility, efficiency in performing tasks and so forth.
