What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is an image or set of images which displays the functional elements of a website or page, typically used for planning a site's structure and functionality.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

The benefits are that it provides an outline to reference as far as structure concerns go, along with providing a rough feel for the eventual user experience.


Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

It was kinda fun...


Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I eventually revised my idea, due to the fact that I had forgotten to include 7 fields for blog post entries.

What questions did you ask during this challenge?

How to insert an image using markdown...still lol.

What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I have yet to find a solid reference which can explain the concept in a dumbed down enough fashion for me...

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

The wireframe sections were both tedious and slightly joyous, if that makes sense.
