REFLECTIONS: Raj V

1. What is a one-to-one database?
	In a one-to-one relationship, each row in one database table is linked to 1 and only 1 other row in another table

2. When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
	In situations where there is a one-to-one link, such as matching customer's name to a customer ID.

3. What is a many-to-many database?
	In a one-to-many relationship, each row in the related to table can be related to many rows in the relating table

4. When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
	Pretty much everywhere else lol.

5. What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
	Nothing really, they are pretty straight forward.
